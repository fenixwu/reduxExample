# Redux Examples
Records for studying es6+, react, redux, react-router, immutable.js...

Please focus on 'app/js' folder.  
The other folders are not important for this subject.  
I'm lazy removing useless packages or settings in this webpack developing package.

## Demo
 * counter_a - A extreme simple Redux example.
 * counter_b - Add immutable.js.
 * counter_c - Add 'redux-logger' by use applyMiddleware.  
 * counter_d - Add 'Redux devTools Extension'.  
 * website   - Add 'router, middleware - asynchronous requests'.  
 ... to be contiuned.

## How to demo
 1. Enter a specific folder
 1. npm i
 1. npm run dev
